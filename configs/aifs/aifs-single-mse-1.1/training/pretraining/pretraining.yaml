# This is the default configuration for training the model
# on the AIFS single model. It is recommended to use this as a base
# configuration and modify it for your own needs.

# For example to change from default GPU count:
# hardware:
#   num_gpus_per_node: 1

diagnostics:
  plot:
    callbacks: []

dataloader:
  # Batch size must be set depending on the number of GPUs
  # and memory available.
  batch_size:
    training: 1
    validation: 1

training:
  # max_epochs: 67
  max_steps: 260000
  lr:
    rate: 3.125e-5 # tests
    iterations: 260000
